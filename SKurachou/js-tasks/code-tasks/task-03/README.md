Your task is to implement `solveEquation` function, wihch solves Quadratic equation.
_Each_ equality has exact 2 _integer_ solutions. Return those numbers as ordered array.

Example:

```js
const solutions = solveEquation("2 * x^2 - 10 * x + 12");
console.log(solutions); // [2, 3]
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
_Be sure, that all tests are positive. That means you cannot catch any error in tests._

## Prepare and test

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Run `npm install` in command line
- Run `npm test` in command line
- You will see the number of passing and failing tests
